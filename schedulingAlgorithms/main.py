# Write a program the implements 3 of the following disk-scheduling algorithms:
# a. FCFS
# b. SSTF
# c. SCAN
# d. C-SCAN
# e. LOOK
# f. C-LOOK
# Your program will service a disk drive with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0-4,999.
# The program will generate a random series of 1,000 requests and service them according to three of the
# algorithms listed above. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head as a parameter
# on the command line and report the total amount of head movement by each algorithm.
