allocate_map():
Creates the structure that will hold the pids, for simplicity's sake just
declare an empty array and return it

allocate_pid():
Generates a random pid within the specified range (MIN_PID,MAX_PID), as a
sanity check looks to make sure the randomly generated integer is indeed
within range, if it is it is appended to the array.
If the pid is already in use, it tries the next logical integer until a unique
one is found

release_pid(int_pid):
Checks if pid to release is in use. If it is, releases it, else returns
an error message


MIN_PID:
sets the min of the range of possible pids

MAX_PID:
sets the max of the range of possible pids

PIDS_IN_USE:
the structure holding the pids in use
