CISC3320 Operating Systems
HW#1: Programming Problem 3.20

Author: Justin Krasner

Problem statement:
Write a program for a mock operating system 'pid manager' that allocates a
unique id to running processes.

Assumptions:
To represent the pids in use I can use any data structure of choice instead 
of creating my own with unique constraints/behaviour. This is why I just 
opted for a simple array.

Initially I thought to create a class for processes that would have a min=300
max=5000 and to design my own data structure as part of its state and create
instances of that class as mock processes, but this seemed to be making things
unnecessarily complex and adding things that were not really asked for.
